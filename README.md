# Nuxt Minimal Starter

This starter starter provides a lightweight and flexible foundation for building Nuxt 3 apps.

## Features

- **Nuxt 3** - The powerful Vue-based meta-framework for SSR, SSG, and hybrid applications.
- **Pinia** - A lightweight state management solution for Vue applications.
- **@nuxtjs/tailwindcss** - A Nuxt module that simplifies Tailwind CSS integration, providing auto-configuration and best practices.
- **@nuxt/icon** - A Nuxt module for easily using various icon sets within your application.
- **@vueuse/nuxt** - A collection of useful Vue composition utilities with Nuxt integration.
- **SCSS (Sass)** - A powerful CSS preprocessor that extends CSS with features like variables, nesting, and mixins.

## Linting

This project uses ESLint with [@antfu/eslint-config](https://github.com/antfu/eslint-config), an opinionated ESLint configuration by Anthony Fu. It includes best practices, modern syntax rules, and auto-formatting for a cleaner codebase.

```bash
# npm
npm install
